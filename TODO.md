# Cambium TODO

## Document Conversion (cambium-document)

Thin integration with a document IR library (separate project).

See `docs/document-ir-spec.md` for comprehensive spec of the document IR:
- Analysis of Pandoc's strengths/weaknesses
- Property-bag based architecture (aligns with Cambium philosophy)
- Layered representation (semantic, style, layout)
- Fidelity tracking for lossy conversions
- Embedded resource handling

**The document IR is out of Cambium's scope** - it's a standalone library project.

cambium-document will:
- [ ] Integrate with document IR library (once it exists)
- [ ] Register format converters with Cambium registry
- [ ] Route document conversions through Cambium's executor

## Audio Encoders (cambium-audio)

Currently only WAV encoding is supported. Adding encoders for other formats:

- [ ] **FLAC encoder** - pure Rust via `flacenc` crate (if stable)
- [ ] **MP3 encoder** - requires `lame` (native dependency)
- [ ] **OGG Vorbis encoder** - requires `libvorbis` (native dependency)
- [ ] **AAC encoder** - requires FFmpeg or native lib
- [ ] **Opus encoder** - consider as modern alternative to OGG

## Video (cambium-video)

- [ ] Complete frame encoding pipeline (currently scaffold)
- [ ] Audio track passthrough/transcoding
- [ ] Subtitle extraction

## Architecture

See ADR-0006 for the Executor abstraction.

Implemented:
- [x] **SimpleExecutor** - sequential, unbounded memory
- [x] **BoundedExecutor** - sequential with memory limit checking (fail-fast)
- [x] **ParallelExecutor** - rayon + memory budget for batch (requires `parallel` feature)
- [x] **MemoryBudget** - semaphore-like reservation with RAII permits

Future work:
- [ ] **StreamingExecutor** - chunk-based I/O for huge files (requires converter interface changes)

## General

- [ ] Batch processing in CLI (`cambium convert *.mp3 --to wav`)
- [ ] Streaming/pipe support for large files
- [ ] Progress reporting for long conversions
